The basis for this is Daimler’s sustainable business strategy. The company thus takes responsibility for the economic, ecological and social effects of its business activities and looks at the entire value chain.

				<h3>MERCEDES-BENZ S-CLASS</h3>
			Mercedes-Benz, much like any other car manufacturer, stops making replacement parts for its cars a certain number of years after the car itself is no longer in production. This is where World Upholstery & Trim comes in. World Upholstery & Trim acquires an actual factory soft-trim part, breaks it down, studies the intricacies of how it was assembled and authentically reproduces it. Our warehouse contains thousands of patterns of seat covers, carpet sets, convertible tops, headliners and other soft-trim parts for Mercedes models from as far back as the 1950s. 30 years of production, delivery and customer feedback has made sure that we have one of the most authentic Mercedes soft-trim parts that you can find in the market. One of the main missions of the company is to be able to provide parts that the original manufacturer can no longer provide and as such we continue to add to our database as the need arises for certain parts and as new generations of cars become old</td>

In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.

The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</td>
