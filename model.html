				<h3>MERCEDES-BENZ X-CLASS</h3>
			Mercedes-Benz, much like any other car manufacturer, stops making replacement parts for its cars a certain number of years after the car itself is no longer in production. This is where World Upholstery & Trim comes in. World Upholstery & Trim acquires an actual factory soft-trim part, breaks it down, studies the intricacies of how it was assembled and authentically reproduces it. Our warehouse contains thousands of patterns of seat covers, carpet sets, convertible tops, headliners and other soft-trim parts for Mercedes models from as far back as the 1950s. 30 years of production, delivery and customer feedback has made sure that we have one of the most authentic Mercedes soft-trim parts that you can find in the market. One of the main missions of the company is to be able to provide parts that the original manufacturer can no longer provide and as such we continue to add to our database as the need arises for certain parts and as new generations of cars become old</td>

				<h3>BUGATTI VEYRON MODELS</h3>With its homage to the fourth, all-black Atlantic, missing since the Second World War, BUGATTI is bringing the speed, technology, luxury and aesthetics of an icon into a new era. But the customized creation of “La Voiture Noire” is far more than a modern interpretation of the ghost of the gran turismo. “La Voiture Noire” is a tribute to BUGATTI’s own history, a manifesto of the BUGATTI aesthetic and a piece of automotive haute couture.</td>

				<h3>BUGATTI LA VOITURE NOIRE</h3>
			A pioneering spirit, passion for perfection and the desire to continually redefine its limits have been the key characteristics of BUGATTI since it was founded more than 110 years ago . None of the brand’s masterpieces reflect these values more impressively than the Type 57 SC Atlantic. Created by Ettore Bugatti’s eldest son Jean, the only four Atlantics ever created stand for pure elegance and sophistication.
